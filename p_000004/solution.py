Problem 4: Largest Palindrome Product
=====================================

Link: https://projecteuler.net/problem=4

Description
===========

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91Ã—99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
